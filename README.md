# B-Sky-Airline
This is the repository for my airline administration system Bsky.

* Documents folder has the documents
* The front end folder contains the React front end
* Airline folder has the spring boot back end

* The application is for a fictional airline company and allows users to search for flights, filter and sort them, book tickets for flights, check their history.
There is also an admin page to add/update/delete existing planes/flights.
* Some components include but are not limited to: pulling and showing data from an online API, automatically sending email when flights are approaching, occupied seat checking
* For testing I use mockito to mock to repositories and cypress for front end testing and integration tests
